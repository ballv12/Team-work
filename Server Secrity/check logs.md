Check done: Role permissions

Issues: I would recommend you give low server security team 0 Role permissions as it could result in nuking. 
And make a role called “Trusted security” with the permissions you feel are deemed necessary, and put it 
above roles to keep watch over them.

Settings changes: None
Current safety of related checks [2-10] Safe now as I will not nuke any roles, but If you hire more security team, 
you may need to turn it off to prevent nuking. Low security team should check channel permission’s access.

Issues: Game staff being able to chat in Infractions and Promotions, punishment guide, staff handbook,
callsigns, how to log shifts.

Setting changes: Permissions to see these channels, for the following roles, @game moderation team,
@trainee game moderator.

Current safety of related check: [5-10] they can chat and potentially spam and or ping, I would get them
turned off immediately.
